    <h2>My Role as the primary network programmer consisted of learning Photon while creating a base game with Photon as the foundation in order to ensure the game would be connected to the network.<br>
        From there it was a matter of syncing the gameplay across the network in order for two players and their actions to be synced within the game.<br>
        After initial implementation and network/gameplay stability I created a lobby chat system before going back to optimations and debugging. </h2>
