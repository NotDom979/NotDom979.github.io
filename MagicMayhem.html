    <h2>My role as the primary network programmer consisted of learning Photon while creating a base game with Photon as the foundation in order to ensure the game connects to the network.<br>
        From there, it was a matter of syncing the gameplay across the network in order for two players and their actions to sync within the game.<br>
        After initial implementation and network/gameplay stability, I created a lobby chat system before returning to optimations and debugging. </h2>

    <h4>My role as the secondary gameplay programmer involved a lot of debugging gameplay mechanics to make sure they operated across the network properly.<br>
        As the generalist I created a shop system, save system, and provided optimizations throughout the game.</h4>
