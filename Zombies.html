    <h2>My role as the primary gameplay programmer included just about everything that had to do with the player controller and the player itself along with the gameloop itself.<br>
        From there, I also implemented each weapon with their own rigidbody bullets and animations, aside from the rocket launcher/grenade.<br>
        After base player mechanics were stable I moved on to creating the wave system and the shop using my teammate's currency system. </h2>

    <h4>My role as the generalist involved mostly debugging and optimizations throughout the game.<br>
        However, I also did minor tasks including using blender to turn the model from 3rd person to a 1st person model. UPDATED</h4>
